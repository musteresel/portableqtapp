Portable Qt Application Proof of Concept
========================================

This repository contains a simple _proof of concept_ Qt GUI desktop application that may be used as a model to build a real portable application.

Portable application is a concept explained in this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_application).

> A portable application (portable app), sometimes also called standalone,
> is a program designed to read and write its configuration settings into
> an accessible folder in the computer, usually the folder where the
> portable application can be found. This makes it easier to transfer the
> program with the user's preferences and data between different computers.

For an application to be truly portable, Qt style settings need to be forced to use the [INI file format](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qsettings.html#Format-enum) instead of the native formats used by default in Windows and macOS, and the users should be able to load and save the settings to a file name and place of their choice.

A PortableSettings class is provided, implementing a [Singleton pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern),
hosting all the program's settings as properties, and providing methods to read and save its properties from and to
native storage and also INI files.

Using the sample
----------------

The program accepts one command line argument:

```
 -p | --portable            Save and load settings from an INI file (portable) 
```

A settings file name with the same name as the application name and a ".ini" file name suffix is used, located at a subdirectory relative to the executable location.

The GUI also provides a menu option to export the settings to an INI file, and a dialog
box to edit the settings.
